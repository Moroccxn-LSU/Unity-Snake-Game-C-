	I CREATED A COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL CLASSIC ARCADE SNAKE GAME                                                                                                             
	IT HAS A FUNCTIONAL STARTUP LOADING SCREEN AND A MAIN MENU SCREEN                                                                                                       
	WITHIN THE MAIN MENU SCENE EXISTS A TRANSPARENT SCENE THAT APPEARS WHEN THE "OPTIONS" BUTTON IS SELECTED                                                                  
	THE OPTIONS MENU HAS A PROMPT TO "CHOOSE YOUR DIFFICULTY" WITH A SLIDER THAT CHANGES THE TEXT STATING THE DIFFICULTY ACCORDINGLY                                                                                                      
	WHEN YOU PRESS "PLAY" THE SNAKE GAME WILL BEGIN AT WHATEVER DIFFICULTY WAS SELECTED AND KEEP TRACK OF YOUR SCORE AND HIGHSCORE TO DISPLAY THEM
